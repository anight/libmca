<h1>MySQL Protocol</h1>
<p>This document descibes the MySQL network protocol version 10, as of
February 2005 (MySQL 4.1.9). It has been produced by reading
mysql_com.h, libmysql.c, net.c, sql_parse.cc and sql_show.cc in the
MySQL source.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>Protocol version 9 was used by MySQL clients and servers before
version 3.21. It is unlikely to still be in use, as modern clients
cannot connect to version 9 servers. The primary difference between
protocol 9 and 10 is in the password algorithm.</p>

<p>Protocol 10 is used by MySQL 3.22 and later. MySQL 4.0 brought in
replication, and MySQL 4.1 brought in a new password algorithm,
together with a number of protocol extensions, such as
multi-statements. It is thus hard for older clients to interoperate
properly with a new server, even if the server has been setup with
pre-4.1 passwords.</p>

<p>This document describes the 4.1.x protocol only; the <a href="http://www.redferni.uklinux.net/mysql/MySQL-323.html">previous document</a> can be used to determine the
changes for older versions.</p>

<h2>Protocol Basics</h2>

<p>The protocol requires first that a client and server negotiate a
connection, including agreeing about protocol features and
authentication. This is followed by a series of requests from the
client and reponses from the server, until either the client issues a
QUIT request or the connection is broken.</p>

<p>MySQL uses either a Unix domain socket (usually
<tt>/tmp/mysql.sock</tt> or <tt>/var/run/mysqld/mysql.sock</tt>), an
MS Windows named pipe (usually <tt>\\hostname\pipe\mysql</tt>), shared
memory or a TCP port (usually 3306). It treats all communications
methods identically.</p>

<p>Each client message is sent as a single MySQL 'packet'; a server
response may consist of many packets. These packets are not related to
the underlying network layer packets, and indeed many response packets
may be contained in a single IP datagram.</p>

<p>Each packet begins with a 4-byte header. The first three header bytes give
the body length as a Little-Endian integer (all MySQL integers are
Little-Endian unless described otherwise). The fourth gives a
packet number for this transaction, starting from 0, and including
both client and server messages. The body of the message then
follows.</p>

<p>All example packets are taken from a real system.</p>

<h2>Connection</h2>

<p>Once the transport-level connection is established, the connection
negotiation starts with the server identifying itself.</p>

<h3>Server greeting</h3>

<p>The host sends an initial greeting similar to:</p>
<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>37 00 00 00</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=55, packet=0</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>0a</tt></td><td>Protocol=10</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>34 2e 31 2e 39 2d 6c 6f 67 00</tt></td>
<td>Version="4.1.9-log"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>07 00 00 00 </tt></td><td>Thread ID=7</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>79 46 2f 57 48 43 57 6a 00</tt></td><td>Salt="yF/WHCWj"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>2c a2</tt></td>
<td>Caps=LONG_FLAG | CONNECT_WITH_DB | COMPRESS | TRANSACTIONS
| PROTOCOL_41 | SECURE_CONNECTION</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>08</tt></td><td>Charset=Latin-1</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>02 00</tt></td><td>Status=AUTOCOMMIT</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</tt></td>
<td>13 bytes unused</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>47 5b 72 4e 6c 58 52 72 66 2b 3f 3a 00</tt></td>
<td>Rest of Salt="G[rNl XRrf+?:"</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The first byte of the message body is the protocol version,
currently 10. The protocol version is followed by a version string for
the server, null-terminated - the -log suffix means logging is
enabled. Following this is a 4-byte integer giving the thread ID of
the server thread handling the request. Next come the first 8 bytes of
a 'scramble string' salt for encryption, again null-terminated.</p>

<p>This is followed by a 2-byte integer describing the
server's capabilities - this server can do LONG_FLAG and
CONNECT_WITH_DB, as well as the more recent COMPRESS, TRANSACTIONS and
SSL, and, as it's a 4.1.x server, PROTOCOL_41 and SECURE_CONNECTION.  There
follow 16 bytes of server characteristics: first a single byte giving
the server character set and two bytes describing the server status;
the rest is currently padded with NUL.</p>

<p>Finally, the remaining 12 bytes of the 'scramble string' are written
if long 20-bytes scrambles are being used (as will usually be the case
with 4.1.x servers that are not upgrades of previous servers).</p>

<h3>Client authentication</h3>

<p>The client now sends a request to the server, similar to:</p>
<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>3e 00 00 01</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=62, packet=1</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>85 A6 03 00</tt></td>
<td>Caps=LONG_PASSWORD | LONG_FLAG | TRANSACTIONS | INTERACTIVE |
LOCAL_FILES | PROTOCOL_41 | SECURE_CONNECTION | MULTI_STATEMENTS |
MULTI_RESULTS</td></tr> 
<tr><td><tt>00 00 00 01</tt></td><td>Max packet=2<sup>24</sup> bytes</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>08</tt></td><td>Charset = Latin-1</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00</tt> x 23</td><td>For future expansion</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>72 65 64 66 65 72 6e 69 00</tt></td><td>User = "redferni"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>14 ??</tt> x 20</td><td>Password = 20 bytes</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>This is the client's turn to send its capabilities in two
bytes. These will always include LONG_PASSWORD, LONG_FLAG,
TRANSACTIONS, PROTOCOL_41 and SECURE_CONNECTION for 4.1.x clients, and
in this case include INTERACTIVE, LOCAL_FILES, MULTI_STATEMENTS and
MULTI_RESULTS as well, as this is the standard MySQL command-line
client.</p>

<p>This is followed by the maxiumum packet size (usually 16MB) and the
client's character set, then 23 bytes of padding.</p>

<p>At this point the client will switch to SSL on the communications
channel if it has set the SSL capability bit - which it will not do if
the server has not also set that bit.</p>

<p>This is followed by the username, null-terminated, and the
scrambled password (the example given here is not a real password) if
a password is provided, preceded with a single byte giving its
scrambled length (usually 20). If no password is provided, a single
NUL is sent and no scramble is added.</p>

<p>If the client is trying to connect to a particular database and the
server is capable of CONNECT_WITH_DB, it will add the database name
as a null-terminated string (in UTF-8).</p>

<p>The client will now expect the server to send an OK simple response or an
error. After an OK response, the flow of client commands can begin;
after an error response the client closes the connection.</p>

<p>Under the very special circumstance that the server and client are
use 4.1 extensions but the server still has an old password table, it
will tell the client to resend the password using the old password
protocol 10 algorithm by sending an end of data packet (the single
byte 0xfe).</p>

<p>If the client and server are both capable of compression, and the
client wants to use it (it usually has to be explicitly enabled), the
client will now switch to using it. It follows the
standard packet header with a three-byte compressed length. The
compression mechanism used is standard zlib.</p>

<p>The client may (if it is the 'commercial', rather than free client)
now check the server's licence by issuing a <tt>SELECT @@license</tt>
statement and abort the connection if the server's licence does not
match the client's.</p>

<h2>Field-length encoding</h2>

<p>When data is sent in tabular form, each field is preceded by
its field length, encoded in the following manner:</p>

<table>
<tbody><tr><th>Byte</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
<tr><td>0-250</td><td>Same as byte</td></tr>
<tr><td>251</td><td>NULL field</td></tr>
<tr><td>252</td><td>Value in following 2 bytes</td></tr>
<tr><td>253</td><td>Value in following 4 bytes</td></tr>
<tr><td>254</td><td>Value in following 8 bytes</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>This mechanism is also used for encoding other integers efficiently.</p>

<p>Fields sent in this manner are marked (FLE).</p>

<h2>Simple response</h2>

<p>Most commands produce a simple 'OK' response. This will usually be
of the form:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>07 00 00 01</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=7, packet=1</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00</tt></td><td>Field count = 0 (FLE)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00</tt></td><td>Affected rows = 0 (FLE)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00</tt></td><td>Insert ID = 0 (FLE)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>02 00</tt></td><td>Server status = AUTOCOMMIT</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00 00</tt></td><td>Warning count = 0</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>In the case of an OK response to the initial authentication, of
course, the packet number will be 2. It is possible that additional
information may follow in FLE.</p>

<p>For an error, the response will be more like the following:</p>

<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>27 00 00 01</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=39, packet=1</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>ff</tt></td><td>Error</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>7a 04</tt></td><td>Error code=NO_SUCH_TABLE (1146)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>54 61 62 6c 65 20 27 72 65 64 66 65 72 6e 69 2e 73 61 6d 70
6c 65 27 20 64 6f 65 73 6e 27 74 20 65 78 69 73 74</tt></td>
<td>Error message="Table 'redferni.sample' doesn't exist"</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The first byte of the error response body is set to 255.</p>

<p>If the body length is at least 4, then the packet contains a 2-byte
error code, followed by the error message, of up to 200 characters.</p>

<p>There are 303 error codes, ranging from HASHCHK (1000) to
CONFLICTING_DECLARATIONS (1302).</p>

<h2>Commands</h2>

<p>A simple command is sent in the form:</p>
<table border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>0f 00 00 00</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=15, packet=0</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>03</tt></td><td>Command=QUERY</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>73 68 6f 77 20 64 61 74 61 62 61 73 65
73</tt></td><td>Arg="show databases"</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The first byte is the command code, followed by an optional
argument. Any command not explicitly listed, including any SQL
command, is sent as QUERY, as in the example.</p>

<h2>Disconnection</h2>

<p>When the client wishes to disconnect, it sends a QUIT simple
command and closes its end of the connection, as follows<br>
<table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>01 00 00 00</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=1, packet=0</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>01</tt></td><td>Command=QUIT</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

</p><p>The server will close its end of the connection without further
response.</p>

<h2>Tabular response</h2>

<p>When returning data as a table, as a response to a QUERY,
FIELD_LIST or PROCESS_INFO command, MySQL first describes the fields
in each row, then sends the rows.</p>

<p>The first packet contains the (non-zero) number of fields, and possibly the
number of records.</p>

<table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>01 00 00 01</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=1, packet=1</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>01</tt></td><td>Number of fields = 1 (FLE)</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>This is followed by the field descriptions.</p>

<table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>1e 00 00 02</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=20, packet=2</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>03 64 65 66</tt></td><td>Catalogue = "def"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00</tt></td><td>DB = ""</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00</tt></td><td>Table = ""</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00</tt></td><td>Org table = ""</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>08 44 61 74 61 62 61 73 65</tt></td><td>Name = "Database"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00</tt></td><td>Org name = ""</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>0c</tt></td><td>Fixed length part = 12 (FLE)</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>08 00</tt></td><td>Char set = Latin-1</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>40 00 00 00</tt></td><td>Length = 64</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>fe</tt></td><td>Type = STRING</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>01 00</tt></td><td>Flags = NOT_NULL</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>1f</tt></td><td>Decimals = 31</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00 00</tt></td><td>Padding</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>There is one logical packet per field description. Each field
description contains seven or eight parts, each preceded by their length
in FLE: the catalogue, database, table, org table,
field and org field names, a 12 byte fixed length set of field
metadata, and an optional default value.</p>

<p>The metadata gives the field character set, type, flags and number
of decimal places.</p>

<table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>01 00 00 03</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=1, packet=3</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>fe</tt></td><td>End of field list</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>After all the field description packets, a packet with just a
single byte of value 254 indicates the start of the rows.</p>

<table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>09 00 00 04</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=9, packet=4</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>06 41 73 68 6c 65 79</tt></td><td>Row 1 Col 1="Ashley"</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>01 31</tt></td><td>Row 1 Col 2=1</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>Each row is in a separate packet, with the field values preceded by
a field length. All non-binary fields values are sent as text - in
particular, all numeric fields appear as ASCII, and timestamps as
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.µµµµµµ. Trailing spaces are removed from char and
varchar fields.</p>

<table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>05 00 00 06</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=5, packet=6</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>fe</tt></td><td>End of row list</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>00 00</tt></td><td>Warning count = 0</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>02 00</tt></td><td>Server status = AUTOCOMMIT</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>After the last row, another packet holding the byte 254, but with
length less than 8 indicates the end of the data. It is followed by
two fields for warning count and server status - for some reason,
these are the opposite way round to a simple response.</p>

<h2>File upload</h2>

<p> If a file is to be sent to the server, the following response is
generated:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%"><tbody><tr><td width="50%"><tt>01 00 00 01</tt></td>
<td>Body Length=1, packet=1</td></tr>
<tr><td><tt>fb</tt></td><td>251 = Upload file</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The file is sent by the client as a series of ordinary packets,
with the final packet empty.</p>

<p>The server will respond, usually with a simple response.</p>


<h2>Complex Responses</h2>

<p>There are four commands that can return complex responses.</p>

<h3>STATISTICS</h3>

<p>The STATISTICS command response is simply a string describing the
current server statistics.</p>

<h3>FIELD_LIST</h3>

<p>The FIELD_LIST command response is the same as the first part of a
tabular response (the field descriptions) - with the exception that a
default value may be attached to each field description.</p>

<h3>PROCESS_INFO</h3>

<p>The PROCESS_INFO command response is first a packet containing a
field count, in FLE, followed by a tabular
response.</p>

<h3>QUERY</h3>

<p>The QUERY command handles all SQL commands, as well as almost all
client commands.</p>

<p>The first part of any response is a number of fields in FLE. A zero
value indicates a simple response; a NULL value indicates a file
upload and any other value indicates a tabular response.</p>

<h2>Semantics</h2>

<p>Many MySQL clients and drivers expect certain behaviour from the
server, and perform queries behind the scenes. The important responses
are shown below.</p>

<h3>Getting current database and user</h3>

<p>The mysql command-line client issues the request<br>
<tt>select DATABASE(),USER()</tt><br>
when the user asks for the current status. It will expect the
following response:</p>

<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>DATABASE()</td><td>USER()</td></tr>
<tr><td>VARCHAR(34) NOT NULL</td><td>VARCHAR(77) NOT NULL</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The DATABASE() field may be empty. The USER() field is of the form
user@host.</p> 

<h3>Status enquiry</h3>

<p>The current status response is similar to:<br>
</p><pre>Uptime: 129  Threads: 1  Questions: 6  Slow queries: 0  
Opens: 6  Flush tables: 1  Open tables: 0 Queries per second avg: 0.047</pre>
<p></p>

<p>The mysql client assumes the number following the first space is a
time and formats it appropriately.</p>

<h3>Show status</h3>

<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>Variable_name</td><td>Value</td></tr>
<tr><td>CHAR(30) NOT NULL</td><td>CHAR(256) NOT NULL</td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Show databases</h3>

<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>Database</td></tr>
<tr><td>CHAR(64) NOT NULL</td></tr></tbody></table>

<h3>Show tables</h3>

<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>Tables_in_<i>db</i></td></tr>
<tr><td>CHAR(64) NOT NULL</td></tr></tbody></table>

<h3>Show fields</h3>

<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>Field</td><td>Type</td><td>Null</td><td>Key</td><td>Default</td><td>Extra</td></tr>
<tr><td>CHAR(64) NOT NULL</td><td>CHAR(40) NOT NULL</td><td>CHAR(1)
NOT NULL</td><td>CHAR(3) NOT NULL</td><td>CHAR(64)</td><td>CHAR(20)
NOT NULL</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>The Null field takes values '' or 'YES' - this is presumably a
bug. The Key field is 'PRI', 'UNI', 'MUL'or ''.</p>

<p>The same output is produced by show columns, desc or describe.</p>

<h3>Show processlist</h3>

<table border="2"><tbody><tr><td>Id</td><td>User</td><td>Host</td><td>db</td><td>Command</td><td>Time</td><td>State</td><td>Info</td></tr>
<tr><td>Int</td><td>CHAR(16) NOT NULL</td><td>CHAR(64) NOT
NULL</td><td>CHAR(64)</td><td>CHAR(16) NOT NULL</td><td>CHAR(7) NOT
NULL</td><td>CHAR(30)</td><td>CHAR(100)</td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>Show processlist full removes the size limit on the Info column.</p>

<h2>Password algorithm</h2>

<p>The new MySQL 4.1.x password algorithm is more complex and probably
more secure than the older algorithms.</p>

<p>The client uses the salt sent by the server and its own knowledge
of the password to produce a scrambled password that it sends to the
server. The server does a similar calculation.</p>

<p>The hashing algorithm used is SHA1 - see RFC 2289, <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3174.html">3174</a></p>

<h3>Scrambling operations</h3>

<p>The client first calculates hash1 = SHA1(password), then hash2 =
SHA1(hash1). The server already knows this, as that is what is held in
its password table (preceded with a *).</p>

<p>It then appends hash2 to the salt sent by the server and hashes
that, and finally exclusive ors the result with hash1.</p>

<p>So it sends to the server SHA1(password) XOR
SHA1(salt.SHA1(SHA1(password)).</p> 

<p>The server does effectively the same calculation and checks the
result (though for some reason it prefers to undo the Exclusive-OR and compare
with hash1).</p>

<h2>Magic numbers</h2>

<table border="2"><tbody><tr><th>Capability name</th><th>Value</th><th>Meaning</th></tr>
